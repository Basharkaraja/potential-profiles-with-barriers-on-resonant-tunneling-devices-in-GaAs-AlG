In this report, we explore applying the localized Green’s function method to solve the onedimensional time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, particularly in configurations relevant to
modeling electron scattering by quantum junctions. We examine potential profiles featuring
variable barriers by focusing on resonant tunneling devices in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures.
Our investigation aims to analyze reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients, considering
the effect of bias and exploring energy bounds.
